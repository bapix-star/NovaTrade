# ⚡ NovaTrade — Cross-Border Supply Chain Milestone Escrow & Financing

NovaTrade is a decentralized trade coordination and financing protocol built on **Stellar Soroban**. It facilitates trustless global trade by allowing Buyers, Suppliers, Logistics Providers, and Inspectors to manage orders, track delivery milestones, dispute shipments, and release financing payments dynamically based on multi-party state-machine verifications.

## 📌 Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Cross-border supply chains suffer from severe counterparty risks, operational opacity, and working capital deficits:
1. **Lack of Payment Security**: Suppliers fear shipping goods without advance payments, while Buyers fear losing funds to untrusted or delayed shipments.
2. **Coarse-Grained Payouts**: Payment terms are often rigid, preventing incremental payouts matching real logistics progress.
3. **Liquidity Lockups**: Suppliers have their working capital locked in escrow or transit for 30-90 days, stifling cash flow.
4. **Dispute Vulnerabilities**: If goods are damaged or misrouted, funds get locked up indefinitely due to lack of transparent multi-party state resolution.

### The Solution: NovaTrade
NovaTrade establishes trust by locking Buyer funds in an on-chain Escrow vault and releasing them programmatically based on verifiable logistics milestones:
- **Dual-Contract Architecture**: Separation of order metadata (`order-contract`) from the actual fund locking/release mechanisms (`escrow-contract`) for high security.
- **Inter-Contract state updates**: When a verified logistics provider or inspector updates a shipment milestone, the `order-contract` performs a cross-contract invocation to `escrow-contract` to execute payouts.
- **DeFi Trade Financing (Factoring)**: Integrates an early liquidity pool allowing suppliers to borrow against their in-transit cargo using their locked order escrow as collateral.
- **Role-based dashboard**: Granular control panel with custom modules tailored to **Buyers**, **Suppliers**, **Logistics Providers**, and **Inspectors**.

## 👥 Level 4 User Onboarding & Feedback

As part of the Level 4 requirements, we onboarded 10+ beta testers to interact with the NovaTrade platform on the Stellar Testnet. Below is a summary of the feedback collected:

### Feedback Summary
1. **Easy Wallet Connectivity**: Testers loved the multi-wallet integration (Freighter, xBull, Albedo), noting that connecting was fast and stable.
2. **Smart Contract Transparency**: Having the escrow balances and milestones state-machine update in real-time gave users high confidence compared to traditional bank-based trade financing.
3. **Suggested Improvements (Addressed)**:
   - *Issue*: Some text and titles were cut off by the fixed header on certain resolutions.
   - *Fix*: Added proper top padding (`pt-16`) to the main page wrapper.
   - *Issue*: Mobile dashboard layouts were initially hard to read.
   - *Fix*: Optimized layout classes for smaller screens.

## 🌟 Progressive Features (Level 1, 2, 3, and 4)

### 👛 Level 1: Core Connectivity & Direct Routing
*   **Multi-Wallet Bridge**: Smooth connection and disconnection handling using the Stellar Wallets Kit (Freighter, xBull, Albedo).
*   **Balance Polling**: Real-time display of connected account balances in XLM, utilizing polling to reflect transaction state changes.
*   **Direct Payments (`/transfer`)**: Secure, validated transfer module supporting recipient address check, input guards, and direct Stellar Testnet transaction submissions.

### ⛓️ Level 2: Inter-Contract State Machine
*   **Dual-Contract Architecture**: 
    *   `order-contract`: Stores order parameters (milestones, roles: Buyer, Supplier, Logistics, Inspector).
    *   `escrow-contract`: Holds buyer's locked funds and handles milestone-specific payout distributions.
*   **Milestone State-Machine**: Tracks transitions from `Created` ➔ `Funded` ➔ `Shipped` ➔ `Delivered` ➔ `Completed` or `Disputed`.
*   **Inter-Contract Invocations**: Auto-invokes payment release hooks inside the `escrow-contract` when specific milestones are marked resolved.
*   **Responsive Control Panel**: Clean, dashboard layouts allowing different actors (Buyer, Supplier, Logistics, Inspector) to perform role-restricted actions with load states.

### 📡 Level 3: Event Logs, Tests, and CI/CD Pipelines
*   **Real-time Event Log**: Dynamic stream pulling event topics and values directly from Soroban RPC ledger logs.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   **Cargo Unit Tests**: 3 Rust smart contract tests validating lifecycle logic and state changes.
    *   **Vitest Suite**: 12 passing tests verifying utility helper conversions (`stroopsToXlm`, `xlmToStroops`, etc.) and key UI components.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Action workflows (`ci.yml`) automating contract compilation, Rust testing, Next.js linting, Vitest runs, and production builds.

### 📊 Level 4: Live Telemetry, On-Chain Factoring & Mobile Polish
*   **Live Telemetry Dashboard (`/dashboard/analytics`)**: Integrated real-time client-side transaction monitoring, wallet event logging, and error tracing with interactive simulation tools to test 10+ user scenarios.
*   **DeFi Trade Financing (`contracts/finance-contract`)**: Deployed a new Soroban factoring smart contract supporting collateralized borrow capabilities, interest rates, and automated repayment triggers.
*   **UI/UX Optimizations**: Optimized navigation for mobile responsive layouts, added smooth micro-animations, and integrated proper loading/error states.
